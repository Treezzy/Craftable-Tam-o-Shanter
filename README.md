Craftable Tam o' Shanter: Mod for Don't Starve Together

A simple mod that adds Tam o' Shanter as a craftable item. This can be useful for people that dislike hunting down MacTusk or want a way to get multiple hats for friends without having to worry about respawn time.

By default, MacTusk will drop the blueprint necessary to craft the hat. This drop is guaranteed. Alternatively, the mod can be configured to allow Tam o' Shanter to be crafted with an Alchemy Engine.
